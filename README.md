🛒 Retail Inventory & Sales Optimization
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail transaction data to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), the dataset is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to identify key business drivers and suggest improvements for inventory and sales strategies.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains retail transaction records with the following columns:

Transaction ID – Unique identifier for each purchase

Date – Date of transaction

Customer ID – Unique identifier for each customer

Gender – Customer gender

Age – Customer age

Product Category – Category of purchased item

Quantity – Number of units purchased

Price per Unit – Cost of each unit

Total Amount – Total revenue from transaction

🛠️ Project Workflow

Data Collection & Loading – Import dataset using pandas

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and data types

Feature Engineering –

Convert Date → Month-Year for sales trends

Create Age Groups for segmentation

Validate Total Amount = Quantity × Price per Unit

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) –
